This code is based on the Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py 
provided in Udacity's course about Programming Foundations with Python. 
There are several things I've added to (or modified in) this module:

The movie-tiles now all have similar height, resulting in rows filled with 
movie-tiles starting from the left. This has been achieved by making sure
 the title will be rendered on a single line (with an ellipsis if needed), and
 reserving 4 lines of space for the plot (and limit its word-count if needed)
Each movie-tile has a block with additional information from the Open 
Movie Database: release date, director, plot, rating on IMDb and metascore
 on Metacritic
For every movie with an MPAA film rating (in OMDb), the rating symbol is 
rendered as an overlay on the movie-poster. Assets for the rating symbols
 have been downloaded from Wikipedia
And more...
A module with classes for the movies can be found in media.py, which has 
a generic Movie-class based on the one used in Udacity's course about 
Programming Foundations with Python. For all the OMDb-related information, 
I have added an OMDbMovie-class which extends the Movie-class.
DOING PROJECT WITH UDACITY WAS GREAT FUN ,I LEARNED DOING TWILIO
